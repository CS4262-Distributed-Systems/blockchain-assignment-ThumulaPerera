### Blockchain Concepts

#### Blockchain Ledger

Ledger is the collection of records of all transactions that have been made on the blockchain.
It is replicated across multiple nodes.
Once a transaction is added to the ledger, it cannot be removed.
This property of immutability is achieved by using a cryptographic technique where each block contains a hash of the previous block.

#### Smart Contract

A smart contract encapsulates the business logic for creating, accessing, modifying and deleting the assets on the blockchain ledger.
Applications belonging to different organizations on the blockchain network can invoke the same smart contract to perform different business transactions.
